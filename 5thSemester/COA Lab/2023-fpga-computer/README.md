8-bit computer modeled after the Simple-As-Possible computers from the book [Digital Computer
Electronics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/942643.Digital_Computer_Electronics) by Malvino and
Brown.

The SAP-3 is the final iteration of the computer and shares an instruction set with the Intel
8080/8085, minus a few instructions.
